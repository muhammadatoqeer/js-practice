// JavaScript is a high-leve,dynamic,interpreted language

//being dynamic and not static means that variables can hold values of different types during runtime

// A script is basically a set of instructions that you give to a computer to perform.

// Expressions are 'phrases' that can be evaluated to produce an output. Expression itself DOES NOT produce the output. It's just used to evaluate the output.

// Each step of the script is known as a statement/instruction. Each instruction usually starts on a new line (Good Code readability practices). It's the statement that stores the values generated by the expressions which alters the state of the program.

//Javascript is a case-sensitive language. 'xyz' is different from 'XyZ' or 'xYz' etc.

/*

In general the language ignores the spaces as long as it can parse/understand the statement or expression. Consider the following code:

let a
a
=
3
console.log(a)
JavaScript interprets this code like this:

let a; a = 3; console.log(a);

// Code blocks are what's between the two curly braces.

// Single-line comment is added by double forward slash

// Keywords are reserved set of words by the programming language which cannot be used out of the context of their use. e.g. function, let, var, const etc.
